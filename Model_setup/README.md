# UC/ED Model setup
Once stochastic inputs are created, a single year is randomly sampled and that year's data is put in the .dat format that is required for the pyomo mathematical optimization library. This script can easily be interfaced with a data mining scheme for selecting specific years/scenarios to run on a cluster.

## CA_data_setup.py
This file populates the data.dat file needed to run the CAISO UC/ED model. Note that the user can specify **hist=1** in order to assign historical monthly production values (**hist_year = 2010 or 2011**) to the two nuclear power plants in the CAISO footprint. If **hist=0**, these plants are assumed to be retired.
